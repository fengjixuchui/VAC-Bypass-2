# VAC-Bypass

Full VAC Bypass
Run steam as administrator, this is so that steamservice.exe isn't loaded, instead the steamservice.dll (VAC) is loaded into steam.exe. 
Then inject the bypass into steam.exe. After this you can start the VAC secured game. 
You must have an injector to use this, art of cheats x86 injector works perfectly okay for this! [『𝔸𝕆ℂ-𝕀𝕟𝕛𝕖𝕔𝕥𝕠𝕣』](https://discord.gg/pJQKYTX4gZ)

What does it do?
- Blocks checking process priveleges
- Blocks checking open system handles
- Blocks checks of process signatures
- Blocks interaction with any potential cheat programmes
- Blocks VAC from checking for executable cheat memory in itself and the game it is protecting
- Blocks ability to find processes loaded onto the system
- Blocks ability to find modules loaded into any process

Does it work?
I had cheat engine opened mutiple times throughout a couple of weeks, still no VAC bans 2 months later, still no bans. I've talked
too many people who have also used it and they haven't been VAC banned, so yes this bypass does work!
